____Code____
- Union-find
  - is the "difference" extension trivial?
  - implement a first version without backtracking
    - check the article about backtracking union-find
  - are representative fixed?
  - difference: simple hashtable

- Options:
  - input from stdin instead of a file


- First version:
  - do not rename literals right now (identify them by their full definition)

  - Main loop:
    - we maintain a list of defined clauses
    - check satisfiability
    - if a clause is undefined, define it (try to define its literals in order)


- Parsing:
   - normalize variables names to have them between 0, nvars - 1

____Tests____
- Make a simple file generator, that converts logical formulas with equality in the target language



____Specs____
- "p cnf" line: is it always like that?


____Misc____
- Clean make target (remove _build and every "*~" file
